# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-08)

**Core value:** Users can securely run and connect agents across all their tools from one place, with production-ready behavior on a self-hosted single-VM deployment.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Security and Deployment Baseline

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Security and Deployment Baseline)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 2 | 8 min | 4 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (1 min), 01-02 (7 min)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Initialization: Keep existing stack and evolve in place
- Initialization: v1 must include MCP implementation plus production-ready security baseline
- Phase 01-01: Non-development startup now fails fast if APP_DEBUG is enabled, API_KEY is missing, or SECRET_KEY is weak/default.
- Phase 01-01: Protected APIs are fail-closed outside development when API auth is unconfigured.
- Phase 01-02: Redaction helper is centralized and applied at persistence, log emission, and API response boundaries.
- Phase 01-02: Settings UI stores only non-sensitive preferences; secrets remain transient session inputs.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- MCP auth/profile variation across third-party servers may require phase-specific validation.
- Existing contract drift risks between frontend/backend require early test coverage.
